# Ken McTran's Project 7 Machine Learning Project

## Overview

Project 7 is an opportunity to work on some Machine Learning concepts


## Workflow:
    Repeatable workflows include the following:
    1. Follow best-practices for git-update-push to ensure workable code are regularly checked-in into cloud-based Github repository. Very brief summary: (i) create a GitHub account (ii) on a local Mac terminal, issue command `git clone https://github.com/ctranimal/datafun-07-ml ' to clone to local computer (iii) at regular interval, check-in stable, working code with helpful comments by issuing command `git add .` , `git commit -m comments` and `git push`
    2. python3 -m venv .venv  <!-- On Mac, this step create a local .venv directory to install tool into --> 
    ## On Mac, next 2 lines install needed tools (documented in requirements.txt ) into .venv environment
    3. python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    4. python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    5. 1. source .venv/bin/activate <!-- On Mac, this command would activate the environment -->
    6. At terminal, use the command "code ~/Repos/datafun-07-ml" to launch VS Code (previously installed on MAC) to open/edit/execute code related to this project.
    7. Within VS Code, open a Terminal windows, to run my written *.py code, issue the commands `python3 *.py`
    8. Within VS Code, open *.ipynb and click on "Run All" to run both Markdown cells and Python code cells.
   
## Documentation on ipynb notebook
    Per the nature of this project #07, pls open tran_ml.ipynb and read everything there from to to bottom (including the Bonus -- Part 05 at the bottom).
